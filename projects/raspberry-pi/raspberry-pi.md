# Welcome to Raspberry Pi Projects! 🎉

## Introduction

Hey there, Raspberry Pi enthusiasts! If you've ever found yourself setting up yet another Raspberry Pi image and thought, "I wish I had documented this," you're in the right place. This project is a treasure trove of Raspberry Pi setups, from server builds and Kali machines to live streaming cameras and more. The best part? It's all documented and shared for everyone to use.

## Why This Project Exists

Raspberry Pi's are fantastic for learning about hardware, programming, and all sorts of techy stuff. But let's be honest—some tasks are repetitive, and some things are just easier when you know how. That's where this project comes in. We aim to:

- Help newcomers get started with minimal fuss
- Educate users on best practices and cool projects
- Automate repetitive tasks to make your life easier

## What You'll Need

This guide assumes you have a basic setup ready to go. Specifically:

- **Operating System**: You're using Linux or Mac. (Windows users, we haven't forgotten you—stay tuned for updates!)
- **Raspberry Pi Setup**: You've installed a desktop server like Raspian (we're using the Bullseye version at the time of writing) on your Raspberry Pi. This [Raspberry pi getting started guide](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html){:rel="noopener noreferrer"} is more than sufficient to get you started.
- **Internet Connection**: You've connected your Raspberry Pi to the internet, either via WiFi or Ethernet.
- **Router Info**: While the guide aims to be as generic as possible regarding routers, it's worth noting that an ASUS router was used for the examples here.
