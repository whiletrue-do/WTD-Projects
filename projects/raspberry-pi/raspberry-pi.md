# Welcome to Raspberry Pi Projects! ðŸŽ‰

## Introduction

Hey there, Raspberry Pi enthusiasts! If you've ever found yourself setting up yet another Raspberry Pi image and thought, "I wish I had documented this," you're in the right place. This project is a treasure trove of Raspberry Pi setups, from server builds and Kali machines to live streaming cameras and more. The best part? It's all documented and shared for everyone to use.

## Why This Project Exists

Raspberry Pi's are fantastic for learning about hardware, programming, and all sorts of techy stuff. But let's be honestâ€”some tasks are repetitive, and some things are just easier when you know how. That's where this project comes in. We aim to:

- Help newcomers get started with minimal fuss
- Educate users on best practices and cool projects
- Automate repetitive tasks to make your life easier

## What You'll Need

This guide assumes you have a basic setup ready to go. Specifically:

- **Operating System**: You're using Linux or Mac. (Windows users, we haven't forgotten youâ€”stay tuned for updates!)
- **Raspberry Pi Setup**: You've installed a desktop server like Raspian (we're using the Bullseye version at the time of writing) on your Raspberry Pi. This [Raspberry pi getting started guide](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html){:target="_blank"} is more than sufficient to get you started.
- **Internet Connection**: You've connected your Raspberry Pi to the internet, either via WiFi or Ethernet.
- **Router Info**: While the guide aims to be as generic as possible regarding routers, it's worth noting that an ASUS router was used for the examples here.
