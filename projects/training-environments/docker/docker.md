# Docker Training Environments

Welcome to the Docker Training Environments section! Here, you'll find a variety of Docker-based setups designed to provide you with hands-on experience and a sandbox to experiment in. Whether you're a beginner looking to get started with Docker or an experienced developer seeking to test out advanced configurations, these environments are built to suit your needs.

## Why Docker?

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. It enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.

## Installing Docker

Before you can use any of the Docker environments provided here, you'll need to install Docker on your machine. Below are the official guides to install Docker based on your operating system:

- **Windows**: [Install Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
- **Mac**: [Install Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
- **Linux**: 
  - [Install Docker for Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
  - [Install Docker for CentOS](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/)
  - [Install Docker for Debian](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/)

After installation, you can verify that Docker is installed correctly by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
docker --version
```

This should display the installed version of Docker.

## Using the Environments

Each mini Docker environment comes with its own set of instructions for setup and usage. These instructions will guide you through the process of pulling the Docker image, running containers, and interacting with the environment.

Typically, you'll find a `README.md` file within each environment's directory, detailing the steps you need to follow. This will include commands to start, stop, and manage the Docker containers related to that environment.

## Pre-requisites

- Basic understanding of command-line interfaces.
- Docker installed on your machine.
